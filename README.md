# Video-object-tracker-based-on-YOLO-and-OpenCV
The trakcer uses YOLO to detect objects periodically - the period is defined by the user. 
The video may be displayed in the time of processing with the bounding boxes and may also be saved.

Make sure to confidure all the paths of YOLO cfg, wights and data files. The trackers have been developed and tested mainly
for people, but they work for other objects as well. 

Make sure to put the YOLO_API file in the a directory which is in the path of project or interpreter
